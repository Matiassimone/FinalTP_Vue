# Twitch Authentication Node Sample
Here you will find a simple Express web app illustrating how to authenticate Twitch API calls using the OAuth authorization code flow.  This sample uses [Express](http://expressjs.com/), [Passport](http://passportjs.org/), and [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/).

## Installation
After you have cloned this repository, use [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to install dependencies.

```sh
$ npm install
```

## Usage
Before running this sample, you will need to set four configuration fields at the top of index.js:

1. TWITCH_CLIENT_ID - This is the Client ID of your registered application.  You can register an application at [https://www.twitch.tv/settings/connections]
2. TWITCH_CLIENT_SECRET - This is the secret generated for you when you register your application, do not share this. In a production environment, it is STRONGLY recommended that you do not store application secrets on your file system or in your source code.
3. SESSION_SECRET -  This is the secret Express session middleware uses to sign the session ID cookie.
4. CALLBACK_URL - This is the callback URL you supply when you register your application.  To run this sample locally use [http://localhost:3000/auth/twitch/callback]

Optionally, you may modify the requested scopes when the /auth/twitch route is defined.

After setting these fields, you may run the server.

```sh
$ node index.js
```

## Next Steps
From here you can add as many routes, views, and templates as you want and create a real web app for Twitch users.
